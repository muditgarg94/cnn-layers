# cnn-layers
This repository contains the matlab code to implement various layers of cnn and backpropagate them . 
All the code is implemented from scratch without using libraries like matcovnet. 
It will help in understanding what exactly is happening while doing forward propagation and back propagation.


Files starting with 'testback' verifies the numerical and anyalytical calculation of the various cnn layers.
